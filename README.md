# Project

Standard procedure to develop any ML/Dl models

Steps:

1: Data Collection ( Raw Data )
2: Data Visualization 
3: Data Processing 
    3.1: Exploratory Data Analusis (EDA)
    3.2: Data deaning
        3.2.1: Null Value detection 
        3.2.2: Data Duplication handling
        3.2.3: Unifarmity in dataset (datatype)
        3.2.4: Data Manipulation
4: Split the data (train, test, Validation (optional))
5: Feature Extraction 
6: Select ML/Dl models
    6.1: Unsupervised 
    6.2: Supervised
    6.3: DL model
7: Build and train the model 
8: Evaluate model 
9: Fine tune the model and repeat step 7 and 8 until you get the better accuracy
10: Justify the model using different matrices
11: Save the model
12: Infer saved model in your Application
